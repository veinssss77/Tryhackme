Junior Security Analyst Intro

TryHackMe – SOC Level 1

1. Role Overview: Junior Security Analyst (SOC Level 1)

A Junior Security Analyst, also known as a SOC Level 1 Analyst, is part of a 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) responsible for monitoring, detecting, and investigating potential security incidents.

The role focuses on:

Identifying suspicious activity

Investigating security alerts

Escalating confirmed threats

Supporting overall organizational security

SOC Level 1 analysts act as the first line of defense against cyber threats.

2. The Security Analyst Journey
Daily Context

Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field where:

New vulnerabilities are disclosed frequently

Threat actors continuously improve their techniques

Organizations are regularly targeted by attacks

Security analysts must stay informed by:

Reviewing cybersecurity news

Tracking recent breaches and attack campaigns

Understanding emerging threat trends

Examples of common real-world incidents:

Large-scale DDoS attacks

Nation-state or politically motivated campaigns

Supply chain compromises

SaaS platform breaches leading to data leaks

Understanding these events helps analysts recognize similar patterns in alerts and logs.

3. Position in the SOC Team

A Junior Security Analyst works:

As part of a team, not alone

Under senior analysts and SOC leads

Within defined procedures and escalation paths

The goal is not to “hack back,” but to:

Detect threats early

Reduce damage

Prevent incidents from escalating

4. Core Daily Duties of a Junior Security Analyst
4.1 Monitoring and Investigating Alerts

Primary responsibility includes:

Reviewing alerts from security tools (SIEM, EDR, IDS)

Determining whether alerts are false positives or real threats

Collecting relevant evidence (logs, timestamps, IPs, user activity)

This requires strong attention to detail and analytical thinking.

4.2 SOC Collaboration and Communication

Junior analysts:

Participate in SOC discussions and shift handovers

Share findings with teammates

Escalate confirmed incidents to Level 2 analysts

Clear communication is critical to avoid missed or duplicated investigations.

4.3 Cross-Team Cooperation

SOC analysts often work with:

IT teams (system issues, patching)

Network teams (traffic anomalies)

Management (incident reporting)

Security is a shared responsibility across the organization.

4.4 Continuous Learning

Threats evolve constantly, so analysts must:

Learn new attack techniques

Understand new defensive tools

Improve investigation and documentation skills

This is why continuous training paths like SOC Level 1 exist.

5. Skills Emphasized at SOC Level 1

This role emphasizes:

Log analysis

Alert triage

Pattern recognition

Documentation and reporting

Understanding attacker behavior at a high level

Advanced exploitation or offensive skills are not the focus at this stage.

6. SOC Relevance (Why This Matters)

This introductory room establishes:

What a SOC analyst actually does daily

Why alert analysis and monitoring are critical

How SOC Level 1 fits into real-world security operations

It sets the foundation for later topics such as:

SIEM usage

Phishing investigation

Network traffic analysis

Incident response workflows

7. Key Takeaway

A Junior Security Analyst is:

A defender, not an attacker

Alert-focused, not tool-obsessed

Process-driven, not guess-based

This role prioritizes accuracy, consistency, and teamwork over speed or complexity.

SOC and Your Team

TryHackMe – SOC Level 1

1. Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team responsible for:

Monitoring security events

Detecting and responding to incidents

Protecting the organization’s systems, users, and data

SOC operations are team-based. No single analyst works alone; each role has a specific responsibility that contributes to overall security.

2. SOC Team Structure and Roles
2.1 Junior Security Analyst (SOC Level 1)

Primary responsibilities:

Monitor and triage security alerts

Perform initial analysis

Identify false positives vs real threats

Escalate confirmed or complex incidents

This role serves as the first line of defense.

2.2 Senior Security Analyst

Role: Advanced analysis and mentorship

Key responsibilities:

Assist junior analysts when investigations are unclear

Handle complex or high-risk incidents

Validate findings before escalation to incident response

Provide guidance and training to junior team members

Senior analysts bridge the gap between alert triage and full incident response.

2.3 SOC Engineer

Role: Security tool management and optimization

Key responsibilities:

Configure and maintain SOC tools (SIEM, EDR, IDS)

Create and tune detection rules

Reduce false positives

Ensure alerts are meaningful and actionable

SOC engineers do not monitor alerts directly but enable analysts to work effectively.

2.4 SOC Manager

Role: Leadership, coordination, and reporting

Key responsibilities:

Oversee SOC operations

Manage analysts and engineers

Report security posture and incidents to management

Ensure processes and workflows are followed

The SOC manager connects technical security operations with business leadership.

2.5 Incident Responder

Role: Major incident handling

Key responsibilities:

Respond to severe incidents (e.g., ransomware, breaches)

Perform containment, eradication, and recovery

Coordinate response across technical and business teams

Incident responders are typically involved only when a serious incident occurs.

3. How These Roles Work Together

SOC workflow typically follows this path:

Alerts generated by security tools

Junior analysts perform initial triage

Senior analysts assist or take over complex cases

Incident responders handle confirmed major incidents

SOC engineers improve detections based on lessons learned

SOC managers oversee and report outcomes

This layered approach ensures efficient and controlled incident handling.

4. Daily Duties and Real-World Scenarios

As a Junior Security Analyst, you may encounter scenarios such as:

4.1 Malware and Endpoint Incidents

Detecting data stealer infections on employee devices

Investigating suspicious processes or outbound connections

Coordinating containment actions

4.2 Phishing Campaigns

Analyzing phishing emails targeting departments like finance

Identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Assisting in blocking malicious senders or domains

4.3 Large-Scale Incidents

Supporting investigations during ransomware attacks

Collecting logs and evidence

Assisting senior analysts and incident responders

4.4 Detection Engineering and Automation

Collaborating with SOC engineers

Helping create or improve detection rules

Participating in automation discussions to reduce alert fatigue

4.5 Business Awareness

Understanding how company operations affect security

Learning why certain assets or users are more critical

Aligning security priorities with business impact

5. Career Progression Insight

SOC Level 1 is a foundation role. With experience, analysts may progress into:

Senior SOC Analyst

SOC Engineer

Incident Responder

Threat Hunter

Security Engineer or Architect

Early exposure to teamwork and processes is essential before specialization.

6. SOC Relevance

This section highlights:

Why SOC work is collaborative

How each role contributes to incident detection and response

Why junior analysts must understand the entire SOC ecosystem

Understanding the team structure improves communication, escalation accuracy, and investigation efficiency.
